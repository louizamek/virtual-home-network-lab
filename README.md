# Virtual Home Network Lab – Cisco Packet Tracer

This project simulates a small secure network using Cisco Packet Tracer. It includes:
- A router, two switches, four end devices, and a web server
- Manual IP addressing and subnetting (192.168.1.0/24)
- Basic router CLI configuration
- Network testing via ping and firewall simulation
